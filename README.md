# Major bookworm who is learning to code 
(currently studying web development remotely at a Swedish Univeristy, Blekinge Institute of Technology.)

My name is Frida and I'm orginally from Sweden, but have been living in Barcelona, Spain for the last 14 years. 

Mostly like coding in JavaScript and Python. I do try to stay away from PHP, but somehow I always end up coding in PHP :sweat_smile:

## Im currently working on

* Writing my Thesis on Green Coding and how Green UX principles can help make a webpage more sustainable. (As you can see my green spots have been down in February as I have been busy researching  ðŸ¤“ðŸ“š)

Also trying to get better at code challenges with Exercism: [Exercism profile](https://exercism.org/profiles/fridavbg)
