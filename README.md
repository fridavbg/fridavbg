# Major bookworm who is learning to code 
(currently studying web development remotely at a Swedish Univeristy, Blekinge Institute of Technology.)

My name is Frida and I'm orginally from Sweden, but have been living in Barcelona, Spain for the last 14 years. 

Mostly like coding in JavaScript and Python. I do try to stay away from PHP, but somehow I always end up coding in PHP :sweat_smile:

## Im currently working on

* A collaborative TextEditor
    * [Frontend](https://github.com/fridavbg/jsramverk-texteditor)
    * [Backend](https://github.com/fridavbg/jsramverk-texteditor-backend)
* Getting better with Docker
   * Setting up various containers one for a server, one for a client etc
   * Regex, sed, grep, awk, bash

Also trying to get better at code challenges with Exercism: [Exercism profile](https://exercism.org/profiles/fridavbg)
